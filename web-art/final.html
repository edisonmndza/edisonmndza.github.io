                 <b>State 1: Stock value is down</b> <br><br>
                 Background: Gloomy red. this color was chosen to indicate that the stock is negative. Red usually represents stop or warning - this is intended to warn people who have invested in this stock to not cash out or else they would obviously lose money. I also chose a gloomy shade of this color to introduce a feeling of sadness. People would generally be sad if they lost money. <br><br>
             
             Animation: Burning money. represents losing money. <br><br></td>

                <b>State 2: Stock value is neutral</b><br><br>
                Background: Grey. this color was to represent the neutral state as grey is one of the most neutral colors our there. <br><br>
                Animation: ZZZ (Sleep). This was chosen to represent a non-moving state. <br><br></td>

                <b>State 3: Stock value is up!</b> <br><br>
                Background: Gold. This color was used to represent the possible earnings for poeple who have invested and are thinking of cashing out. <br><br>
                Animaztion: Raining money! This one is self explanatory</td>
